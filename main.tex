    This styled article class, inspired by the LIPIcs template and the layout of \href{https://github.com/BenjaminGor/Latex_Notes_Tutorial}{Benjamin Gor's tutorial}, was created due to my displeasure of the plain article templates used by many maths and computer science journals. May this class provide a pleasant reading experience for your paper, without distracting from its beautiful contents.
